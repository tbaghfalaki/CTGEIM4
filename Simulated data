# CTGEIM4 package


> Run a Gibbs sampler to cluster time-course gene expression data set. For this purpose, a non-parametric Bayesian approach by considering a Dirichlet process for the mean of a marginal model with first order autoregressive of the within-gene covariance matrix.

> Here we provide a comprehensible detailed vignette to cluster time-course gene expression data using CTGEIM4 package.

> We illustrate the inference by some simulated summary statistics.

> This vignette can reproduces a part of the simulation study of our submitted paper entitled as follows:

  > Clustering time-course gene expression data using an infinite mixture model prior for marginal model.


**Getting Started**

  > In this vignette we used the following R packages
- library(mvtnorm)
- library(ComplexHeatmap)
- library(circlize)
- library(R2jags)
- library(mcclust)

**Example Usage**
  > Examples from the CTGEIM4 can be found in the following:

- CTGE_IM4: This analysis is presented [here](/CTGE_IM4 _Examp.md)
